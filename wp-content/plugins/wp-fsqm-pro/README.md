## Description

eForm is an advanced and flexible form builder that can be integrated into your existing WordPress site. This is a complete form management solution, for quizzes, surveys, data collection and user feedback of all kinds.

With the quick and easy drag and drop form builder, you can build unlimited forms and manage them from your admin dashboard. All submissions are stored in your eForm database, so you can view, track, analyze and act on the data you have captured. A user portal also allows registered users to review and track their submissions.

We have integrated eForm with the best in class e-mail newsletter providers and payment services, for even greater flexibility and security.

This robust and comprehensive form builder is the perfect combination of style and functionality: packed with all the elements you need, while clean and elegant to use.

## Complete UI Revamp

Starting version 3.5.0 eForm now has removed all old form themes. If you want them, it can found under tag 3.4.0.

We now concentrate on the material themes.

## IMPORTANT NOTICE

Starting version 3.3.0, previously FSQM Pro is now known as `eForm - WordPress Form Builder`. A re-branding was long due and we finally took the courage to do it. If you ask why, there are really two simple reasons.

 * **Better impression on our customers**. This is after-all a form builder plugin and the name `FSQM Pro` (although served us good for many years) was not really reflecting the product characteristics. We hope eForm (Short for electronic form, as with email) will get rid of this confusion for good.
 * **Better SEO**. From search engine standpoint, `eForm` seems to be a really nice keyword. We hope to get more exposure for our product.

Re-branding is a lot of work and we are slowly getting there. For now, all URLs with `fsqm` in it will remain so. In future if we decide to change, then we will make sure the redirections are setup properly so that you do not have to take care of anything.

## Plugin Usage and Documentation

We understand that reading through heaps of documentation can be tedious and time-consuming, so you’ll see a help icon beside every element in the form builder to guide you through the features you want to use.

[Video tutorials](http://ipanelthemes.com/kb/fsqm/fsqm-video-tutorials/) and [full support documentation](http://ipanelthemes.com/kb/fsqm/) are also available, giving you step-by-step instructions and screen shots, so that you can get the most out of your eForm WordPress form builder.

## Requirements

Before purchasing, please make sure your server meets the following minimum requirements:

 * WordPress version: 3.5.x+
 * PHP version: 5.3.x+
 * Recommend PHP memory limit: 96M or more. Should also work on 64M, depending on number of plugins.
 * MySQL version: 5+
 * Mcrypt library (this comes pre-installed on most of the hosts)
 * Minimum value of 2048 for many Suhosin variables. Please refer to our FAQs to learn how to set this up.

## Updating from version 1.x

If you’re updating from version 1.x, please follow this [guide carefully](http://ipanelthemes.com/kb/fsqm/fsqm-installation/updation-guide/#ipt_kb_toc_711_3) (click on Updating to Latest Version in the sidebar) to safely migrate all your data.

## Compatibility

Since version 2.x, the pro plugin can work in parallel with the free plugin. However, the pro plugin will not import any data from the free plugin, so if you wish to, you must do so manually. It is recommended that you delete the free plugin before installing the pro, as you will no longer need it.

It is not possible for us to make the plugin compatible with every theme on the market. If your theme has followed the WordPress standard of coding, then this plugin will definitely work.

Some reasons why the plugin might not work with certain themes:

 * Your theme or any other plugin has changed the WordPress default jQuery file.
 * Your theme or any other plugin has changed the WordPress default jQuery UI files.
 * Your theme or any other plugin is including a different copy of jQuery or jQuery UI from its own resource.

Whatever the reason, it is not a standard way to change any of the default inbuilt WordPress files. If the form does not seem to work with your theme, please open a thread in our [Support Forum](http://ipanelthemes.com/kb/support/forum/wordpress-plugins/wp-feedback-survey-quiz-manager-pro/). We will assist you with contacting the developer of your incompatible theme/plugin to fix the problem. We have also published a series of [troubleshooters](http://ipanelthemes.com/kb/fsqm/fsqm-troubleshooting/), which may come in handy.
